### A Ruby library to read and write [KeePassX](http://www.keepassx.org/) databases.

## Installation

```sh
gem install keepassx
```

or if you use bundler

```ruby
gem 'keepassx'
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'keepassx'

database = Keepassx::Database.open("/path/to/database.kdb")
database.unlock("the master password")
puts database.entry("entry's title").password
```

## Security Warning

No attempt is made to protect the memory used by this library; there may be something we can do with libgcrypt's secure-malloc functions, but right now your master password is unencrypted in ram that could possibly be paged to disk.
